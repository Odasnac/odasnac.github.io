      <description>Great sales people teach their clients a different way to think about their issues.
Teach your clients on new approaches to succeed in their business.
Get better by learning about issues in their industries and how to apply your capabilities (products &amp;amp; services) to address them.
Keep learning about data, technology, new trends and how to apply those for your customers. That is how you bring value to them.
That is meaningful work, as you help your clients achieve success by having a big positive impact in their organizations.</description>
