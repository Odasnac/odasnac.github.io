      <description>It was striking to see in Benjamin Zander&amp;rsquo;s Ted talk his capacity to &amp;ldquo;move&amp;rdquo; people. Note how he delivers his talk, how he brings attention and accent to different parts of it, how he uses stories, how he makes it so inspiring and emotional.
His stories were meant to make people emotional, so that the impact is far greater.
At the end it shows how leadership is about moving others to action.</description>

      <description>Viktor Frankl wrote his experience to endure and survive four concentration camps between 1942 and 1945.
The viennese psychiatrist wrote &amp;ldquo;Man&amp;rsquo;s Search for Meaning&amp;rdquo; in just 9 days and intended to publish it anonymously. He was surprised by its success as an international bestseller, and saw in it the symptom of the &amp;ldquo;mass neurosis of modern times&amp;rdquo; since the title promised to deal with the question of life&amp;rsquo;s meaningfulness.
The first part of the book recounts his experience in dealing with the worst and cruelest conditions a human being can think of, and how still some of them managed to survived.</description>

      <description>Great sales people teach their clients a different way to think about their issues.
Teach your clients on new approaches to succeed in their business.
Get better by learning about issues in their industries and how to apply your capabilities (products &amp;amp; services) to address them.
Keep learning about data, technology, new trends and how to apply those for your customers. That is how you bring value to them.
That is meaningful work, as you help your clients achieve success by having a big positive impact in their organizations.</description>

      <description>The Serenity Prayer in bullets:
*God, grant me the
serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. This prayer combines so well with these words in the I Ching (translation of Brian Browne Walker):
Ebb and flow are inherent in the nature of life. When difficulties arise, accept this and hold firmly to what is correct. Good fortune returns to those that remain calm and detached.</description>
