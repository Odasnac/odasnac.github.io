      <description>It was striking to see in Benjamin Zander&amp;rsquo;s Ted talk his capacity to &amp;ldquo;move&amp;rdquo; people. Note how he delivers his talk, how he brings attention and accent to different parts of it, how he uses stories, how he makes it so inspiring and emotional.
His stories were meant to make people emotional, so that the impact is far greater.
At the end it shows how leadership is about moving others to action.</description>

      <description>The Serenity Prayer in bullets:
*God, grant me the
serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. This prayer combines so well with these words in the I Ching (translation of Brian Browne Walker):
Ebb and flow are inherent in the nature of life. When difficulties arise, accept this and hold firmly to what is correct. Good fortune returns to those that remain calm and detached.</description>
