      <description>It was striking to see in Benjamin Zander&amp;rsquo;s Ted talk his capacity to &amp;ldquo;move&amp;rdquo; people. Note how he delivers his talk, how he brings attention and accent to different parts of it, how he uses stories, how he makes it so inspiring and emotional.
His stories were meant to make people emotional, so that the impact is far greater.
At the end it shows how leadership is about moving others to action.</description>
